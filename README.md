# Procrastination Paradise

## Description

Procrastination Paradise is a hilariously useless web application designed to help users waste time in the most entertaining ways possible. It's the perfect tool for when you want to avoid being productive!

This project is a tongue-in-cheek take on productivity apps, offering features that are intentionally counterproductive. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to run in any modern web browser.

## Features

- **Productivity Destroyer**: Generates random, humorous excuses for not working.
- **Time Waster**: A pointless game where users can "waste" virtual minutes.
- **Useless Fact Generator**: Displays random, trivial facts that serve no practical purpose.
- **Procrastination Progress Bar**: A progress bar that fills up automatically, giving users a sense of "achievement" for doing nothing.
- **Anti-Todo List**: Allows users to add tasks they don't want to do, completely defeating the purpose of a todo list.
